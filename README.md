###Question 1.  Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
This program demonstrates the Faker.js library.

###Question 2.  How does someone run your program? 
This program is fairly simple to run, all you need to do is call each function's corresponding fill function,(n being the number of items you want), then take the corresponding array and call each function.

###Question 3. What purpose does your program serve?
This program as three functions to show off different parts of Faker.js

The first function does a simple bubble sort of account numbers generated by Faker.js

The second function takes an array of words and finds the average length. The array of words is generated by Faker.js

The last function just shows off some of the most niche features, in this case being airplane seats
